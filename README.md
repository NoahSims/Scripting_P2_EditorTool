Project for Scripting for Games II

This project was to create a tool for the unity editor.
My tool, Shop Builder Pro, is designed to assist a game designer in creating a shop for their game. The intention for this was for use in any kind of rpg like game where there may be multiple shops for the player to find, each with their own seperate inventories. This could, however, help in any game with a shop element.\
The tool is used for creating and editing a scriptable object that stores the data defining the shop. This game object could then be plugged into a gameobject with some ui elements to create an in game shop.
